The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts.

## Objective
> Given a personâ€™s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.

  1. Some of the features, such as ID, Name, SSN, and Customer ID, were unique for every data point and did not affect the prediction.
  2. The feature types of loans were difficult to understand
  3. Temporal feature Credit History Age was an string rather than numerical
  4. Other numerical features were being treated as objects.
  5. There were missing values ,corrupt values and outliers present in the dataset.
